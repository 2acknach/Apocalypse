<h3>Salary</h3>
<p>To maintain your standard of living in Hayward you need to be earning $65,506.0 a year. The average salary for an entry level web developer is currently $69,946.00. If this was your first job in the field you will probably be on the lower end of the spectrum. Now we have to take into account taxes and students debt. Let's say we have to pay off a $10,000 debt in five years with an interest rate at 5%, that would be $253.5 lox a month. Now in taxes we have to pay $18,048 yearly. That's because federal tax is 18.15% and state insurance taxes are 7.75%. That results in a total of 25.8% off your paycheck, which comes in at $1058.00 and $446.00 respectively. Add that up and you have $1504.00 per month, multiply that by twelve and you have the yearly amount. Divide the total salary by 12 so you get the monthly rate, that comes in at $5,828, subtract the tax and student loans you're making $4,192 monthly. Multiply that by twelve to find the amount going into your bank account yearly, you get $50,313. That leaves you comfortably $12,807 over the amount that was recommended for a decent standard of living.</p>
<p>Oh course, maybe that salary coming straight out of college is a little bit ambitious. Not completely unprecedented though, at least I don't think. To buy the various things you need we found the costs to be around $2,038.97 monthly, leaving $2553.81 to either save and spend on leisure activities. Costs add up quick. This number may be a little high, but I doubt it off by too much to make it completely irrelevant.</p>
